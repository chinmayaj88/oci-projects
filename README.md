# 🚀 OCI Projects – Hands-On Cloud & DevOps Portfolio  

A curated portfolio of **real, production-style Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)** and **DevOps automation projects**, built to demonstrate strong foundations in **cloud architecture, CI/CD delivery, and infrastructure-as-code engineering**.  

Each project combines **hands-on implementation** with a **practical DevOps mindset** — built to scale, secure, and automate.

## 🎓 For Learners  

1️⃣ Pick a project folder and start with its README.md  
2️⃣ Follow the steps from **provision → deploy → validate → teardown**  
3️⃣ Explore Terraform and scripts to see how OCI services connect in practice  
4️⃣ Extend with your own modifications using the “What’s Next” section  

📘 These projects teach not just *what to do*, but *why it’s done that way* — blending cloud fundamentals with engineering judgment.
